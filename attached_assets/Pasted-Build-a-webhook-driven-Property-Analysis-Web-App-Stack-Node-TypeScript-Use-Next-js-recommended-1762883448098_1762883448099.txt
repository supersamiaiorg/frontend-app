Build a webhook-driven Property Analysis Web App 
Stack: Node + TypeScript. Use Next.js (recommended) or Express + Vite React.
 No auth. Only external dependency is the existing n8n webhook.
External analysis trigger
POST https://supersami.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/d36312c5-f379-4b22-9f6c-e4d44f50af4c
It accepts:
{
  "property_url": "<listing-url>",
  "frontend_callback_url": "<PUBLIC_BASE_URL>/api/analysis/callback"
}

It may take minutes. Do not poll—n8n POSTs the final result to our callback.

Env & config
Create .env:
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://<your-public-host>
TEST_MODE=false
PORT=3000

PUBLIC_BASE_URL must be public HTTPS so n8n can reach it.


TEST_MODE=true enables a local simulation route that feeds the exact sample JSON below.



API (server)
Implement all:
POST /api/trigger
 Body { property_url: string } → validate; POST to n8n with { property_url, frontend_callback_url: <PUBLIC_BASE_URL>/api/analysis/callback }.
 Return { ok: true, property_url }.


POST /api/analysis/callback
 Body is the FINAL result (array with one object).


Validate minimal shape.


Normalize with the adapter below.


Store by super_id (if present) and by property_url (best-effort from payload or request context).


Notify any waiting SSE clients (/api/stream) with { ready: true, super_id }.


Return 200.


GET /api/stream?property_url=... (SSE)


If we already have results for that property_url, immediately emit { ready: true, super_id }.


Else hold up to 15 min, send heartbeat every 25s.


GET /api/results?super_id=... (preferred) or ?property_url=...


Return the normalized result. 404 if not found.


GET /api/proxy-csv?url=... (optional)


Server-side CSV fetch; Content-Type: text/csv. Use only if browser hits CORS.


POST /api/simulate-callback (TEST_MODE only)


Loads server/fixtures/sample_callback.json and routes it through the same logic as /api/analysis/callback.



Incoming payload shape
The production webhook currently posts an array with one object, shaped like:

Validation rules:
Floorplan requires at least one of inline_csv or fp_json_csv_url. If neither → 400 "floorplan CSV missing".
Accept presence/absence of data_captured; render gracefully if missing.
Security: Sanitize any HTML strings (fullDescription, propertyDisclaimer, feesApplyText) before rendering to avoid XSS.


Pages (routes)
/ (Input)


Field: property_url (required).
On submit: POST /api/trigger, then navigate to /waiting?property_url=....
/waiting
Show “Processing… this can take a few minutes.”
Open EventSource(/api/stream?property_url=...).
Heartbeat message every 25s (server).
Soft timeout message after ~12min but keep waiting up to ~15min.
On {ready:true, super_id} → navigate to /results?property_url=...&super_id=....
/results
Fetch /api/results?super_id=... else ?property_url=....
Render 3 tabs:


A) Property Data
Data Captured panel:
Header with status, context, timestamp (UTC → local).
Summary chips: completed_endpoints / total_endpoints.
Metadata row: property_id, client_id, callback_url (link), property_url (link).
Snapshot card (from data_captured.snapshot):
Top row: transactionType, channel, badges (statusLabel, tags).
Key facts grid: bedrooms, bathrooms, size.primary (with secondary muted), price.primary (with secondary), postcode.
Address & Agent: address, agent.displayName (+ phone), agent.logo, agent.address.
Links: propertyUrl, brochureUrl, schoolCheckerUrl, soldPricesUrl, marketInfoUrl.
Media:
Photo gallery (thumbnails → modal).
Floorplan thumbnails → open.
EPC images (lightbox).
Map preview image if present.
Nearby: compact tables for stations and schools (name, distance, rating where present).
Features: keyFeatures list if present.
Disclosures (collapsible): sanitize & render html.fullDescription, html.propertyDisclaimer, html.feesApplyText.
If no data_captured → show “No property snapshot available yet.”


B) Floorplan Analysis
Display source precedence:
Use floorplan.inline_csv (parse CSV text)
Else fetch from floorplan.csv_url
Always show downloads & media:
“Download floor CSV” → floorplan.csv_url (if present)
“Download totals CSV” → floorplan.total_area_csv_url (if present)
“Download raw JSON” → floorplan.json_url (if present)
Display floorplan.labelme_side_by_side_url image at top.
Table rules:
Columns exactly as in the sample CSV.
Group by Floor_Name, sort by Room_id.
Toggle Metric/Imperial (show correct columns).
Floor subtotals + Grand Total.
Show “—” for unknown/missing values.
Sticky header, horizontal scroll, basic sort & filter.
C) Image Analysis
Use image_condition (if present).
Show overall_condition (label, average_score, confidence).
Render label distribution chart from overall_condition.label_distribution.
Show merged image galleries and detailed table (thumbnail + condition_label + condition_score + room_type + reasoning).
Gracefully handle missing sections.
UI: Clean, responsive; tabs on desktop, dropdown on mobile.

Frontend helpers
Prefer a lightweight CSV parser (Papa Parse).
Use fetch to get CSV text from URL (or /api/proxy-csv?url=... if CORS).
Avoid crashes on missing fields.
HTML sanitization: DOMPurify (or server-side sanitize to safe subset).
Lightbox/gallery: lightweight (no giant bundles).

No-fabrication rule
Never fabricate callback data.
Only use real /api/analysis/callback posts or the manual test endpoint when TEST_MODE=true.
Log clearly: “Callback received for property_url=..., super_id=...”.

Developer utilities
Create server/fixtures/sample_callback.json.
 Paste the FULL JSON you (the user) supplied (the big array with final_result).
When TEST_MODE=true, allow:
POST /api/simulate-callback (no body): reads that file and feeds it into the same save/notify logic as the real callback.
Provide npm scripts:
dev (start server + client)
build, start

Acceptance tests (happy path)
Visit /, enter a Rightmove URL, submit → lands on /waiting with SSE active.
When the real webhook calls /api/analysis/callback, the page auto-advances to /results?....
Property Data tab: shows Data Captured panel and Snapshot (facts, media, links, disclosures).
Floorplan tab displays the table (from inline_csv if present, else fetched from csv_url), labelme image, and download links.
Image Analysis tab shows overall condition metrics, chart, galleries, and details.
With TEST_MODE=true, calling POST /api/simulate-callback drives steps 2–4 using server/fixtures/sample_callback.json.

Non-200 behaviors
/api/results → 404 JSON {error:"not found"} if missing.
/api/analysis/callback → 400 JSON with a clear message if validation fails (e.g., both inline_csv and csv_url missing).
SSE endpoint keeps the connection open and sends heartbeats.

Build this exactly as specified.
